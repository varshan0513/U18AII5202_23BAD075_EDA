## 📌 Project Description

This experiment demonstrates the use of **advanced multivariate visualization techniques** using R and `ggplot2` to analyze retail business data. The project focuses on visual interpretation of relationships between multiple variables such as **Sales**, **Profit**, **Customer Segment**, and **Region**.

The visualizations implemented help in:

* Understanding multidimensional relationships
* Identifying patterns and trends
* Comparing customer segments
* Regional performance analysis

---

## 📂 Dataset Used

**File Name:** `6.retail_business.csv`

### Expected Columns:

* `Order_ID`
* `Sales`
* `Profit`
* `Customer_Segment`
* `Region`

---

## 🛠 Libraries Required

The following R libraries are used in this experiment:

```r
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
```

---

## 🔄 Data Preparation Steps

* Dataset loaded using `read.csv()`
* Data structure checked using `str()`
* Summary statistics generated using `summary()`
* Data type conversion:

  * `Region` → Factor
  * `Customer_Segment` → Factor

---

## 📊 Visualizations Implemented

### 1️⃣ Parallel Coordinate Plot

**Purpose:**
To visualize relationships between **Sales** and **Profit** across different **Customer Segments**.

**Features:**

* Multiple observations plotted as connected lines
* Color-coded by customer segment
* Helps identify trends and variability

**Variables Used:**

* Sales
* Profit
* Customer_Segment
* Order_ID

---

### 2️⃣ Bubble Chart

**Purpose:**
To analyze the relationship between **Sales** and **Profit** with magnitude representation.

**Features:**

* X-axis: Sales
* Y-axis: Profit
* Bubble size: Sales volume
* Bubble color: Customer segment

**Insights:**

* Identifies high-value customers
* Visualizes profit concentration
* Shows sales dominance patterns

---

### 3️⃣ Trellis Display (Facet Plot)

**Purpose:**
To compare sales-profit relationships **region-wise**.

**Features:**

* Faceting by `Region`
* Separate plot for each region
* Color-coded customer segments

**Benefits:**

* Regional comparison
* Market performance evaluation
* Segment behavior analysis

---

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

After completing this experiment, students will be able to:

* Understand multivariate data visualization
* Implement parallel coordinate plots in R
* Design bubble charts for multivariable analysis
* Use faceting for comparative visualization
* Apply tidyverse tools for data transformation
